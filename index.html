                Hello! My name is Jill and I am currently an Early Childhood Special Education Teacher. I have
                been employed as a teacher for almost 7 years. With many changes coming next year, I too decided
                I need change. I have always been interested in computers and exploring how they function.
                With that in mind, I have decided to change careers and take the necessary steps into becoming
                a Web Developer. Since I am only at the beginning of my Bootcamp, I can say it has been
                challenging but also exciting. I am ready for a new direction in my life.
                On a personal level, I am a single parent raising my amazing 14 year old daughter. She is
                actively involved in Club Volleyball so WE basically eat, sleep, and breathe volleyball. Our week nights
                right now are consumed with trainers, physical therapy, and practice. It is exciting to see all her
                hard work come together when they have tournaments on the weekends. She is excited for this change in our
                life.
